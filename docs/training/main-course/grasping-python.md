# You gotta understand: Important things for grasping Python

## Syntax

Just the basic rules to be able to understand Python code, informally.

### Statements

**Single statement**:
A single statement is an executable instruction ending with a newline or
semicolon. A statement changes the state of the program.

#### Expressions

An expression is a sequence of **operands** and **operators** evaluating to a
single value. Operands can be expressions themselves.

Examples:

``` python
"foo"        # string literal
3.14         # float literal
True         # boolean literal
a            # simple identifier
a + b        # simple expression using add-operator
x == y       # simple expression using equal-comparison operator
id(x)        # simple expression using id()-builtin function getting the
             # object id of the object the variable 'x' refers to
a is b       # simple expression using 'is'-operator
             # (check identity as with id()-builtin function)
```

The evaluation (calculation) of an expression itself is triggered by an
appropriate statement - in an interactive interpreter session this means you
need to finish your entered expression with a carriage return (newline), this
will make an expression statement out of an expression.  Expressions are
printable and assignable. Because expressions are assignable, they form the
smallest unit of reusable code. 

Example - expression statement:

``` python
>>> 5 + 3 # expression statement
8
>>>
```

##### Operands and Operators

Operands are literals, identifiers (variable names) or functions returning a single value. Operators are (meaningful) links between operands.


#### Assignments

Assignements assign values (result of expressions) to names.

Example - assignment statement:

``` python
>>> a = 5 + 3 # assignment statement
>>> a         # expression statement
8
>>>
```

#### Other Statements

In simple terms, other statements are basically "everything else that can form
a Python line or group of lines".

There are both "simple" statements (like e.g. `del`, `import`, `return`,
`yield`, ...) but also "compound" statements (e.g. `if-elif- else`, `for`,
`while`, ...) that contain other statements.

You can read up all the details on expressions and statements in the [Python
reference documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/).

#### Indentation

Grouping statements - i.e. building code blocks - is the basis for structuring
a program. Organized in "higher-level" building blocks like functions, classes,
modules and packages, they provide reusable code fragments. 

A sensible "program organization" is crucial for creating

  - understandable
  - maintainable
  - extendible
  - testable

code.

Python uses **indentation** to denote blocks of code (as opposed to e.g. {}
braces in many other languages).[^braces-blocks] Many love it, some don't care
all that much, a few hate it. We believe that this is one reason why Python is
so inherently readable.

[^braces-blocks]:
    E.g in Java or C, the semicolon `;` is used as single-statement-delimiter,
    the curly braces `{` `}` are used for code blocks.

Consecutive statements can be grouped together forming a code block using the
same indentation level:


``` python
>>> if need_cake:
>>>     make_dough()    # three
>>>     add_toppings()  #       steps
>>>     bake()          #             in the same code block
```

Indentation must be consistent:
``` python
>>> if True:
...     print('True!')
...       print('Still true.')
  File "<stdin>", line 3
    print('Still true.')
    ^
    IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

Always use 4 spaces for one level of indentation.[^indentation]

[^indentation]: While this is not mandatory and enforced just do it :wink:.

#### Comments

Comments are used for documenting the code in-place. 

A comment starts with a "#" and ends at the end of a line:

``` python
>>> # a comment
... print('something')  # an inline comment
something
```

The Python interpreter ignores comments.

### Literals

#### Numeric Literals

``` python
>>> 12345  # integer
12345
>>> 123.45  # floating-point number
123.45
>>> 1 + 3j  # complex number with real and imaginary part
(1+3j)
>>> 1.1 + 3.1J  # another complex number with real and imaginary part
(1.1+3.1j)
```

You can optionally separate big numbers for easier human reading:

``` python
>>> 1000_000_000  # not peanuts
1000000000
```


#### String Literals

All these are valid string literals i.e. text or "sequences of characters":

``` python
>>> """text"""
'text'
>>> '''text'''
'text'
>>> "text"
'text'
>>> 'text'
'text'
```

You can use the different variations to avoid escaping. I.e. instead of
``` python
>>> 'Guido\'s time machine'
"Guido's time machine"
```

simply use

``` python
>>> "Guido's time machine"
"Guido's time machine"
>>> 
```

### Docstrings
A string literal as 1st statement in a module, a function or a class
definition will become the so-called "documentation string" of this object, 
which is accessible as the object's `__doc__` attribute:

A documented function:

``` python
>>> def noop(x):
...     """noop does nothing, really."""
...     return x
... 
>>> noop.__doc__
'noop does nothing, really.'
```

A documented class:

``` python
>>> class Animal:
...     """I'm a beast.
...     """
... 
>>> Animal.__doc__
"I'm a beast.\n    "
>>> 
```

A documented module:

``` python
$ cat mymodule.py 

"""This is my module's docstring.
"""

import os

print(os)
$ python3 -q
>>> import mymodule
<module 'os' from '/opt/subtools/current/lib/python3.6/os.py'>
>>> mymodule.__doc__
"This is my module's docstring.\n"
>>>
```

If for some reason you can't put this docstring as the first module statement
you may alternatively just set `__doc__` (as a module-global variable):

``` python
$ cat mymodule2.py 
import os  # for some reason we want to do this first

__doc__ = """This is my module's docstring.
"""

print(os)
$ python3 -q
>>> import mymodule2
<module 'os' from '/opt/subtools/current/lib/python3.6/os.py'>
>>> mymodule2.__doc__
"This is my module's docstring.\n"
>>> 
```

### Valid Identifiers & Reserved Words

Identifiers are the names you are allowed to use e.g. for variable, function or
class names.

You can find out all there is to know about identifiers here:
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers

As a basic rule of thumb identifiers consist of letters A to Z (uppercase and
lowercase), the underscore _ and digits 0 to 9. Identifiers must not start with
a digit.[^identifiers]

[^identifiers]:
    Since Python 3.0 you can actually use other unicode characters in
    identifiers though in international codebases, the ASCII range characters
    prevail.

Identifiers are case-sensitive.

Reserved words are the language keywords which are not allowed for use as a 
name:
```
False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield
```

### Source code encoding

Source code is text data. The binary representation of text data (e.g. when
stored in a file) is called an "encoding". It is important to know the encoding
of a text file since

 - different encodings are capable of representing different characters and
 - interpret the binary data as different characters (e.g. the ISO-8859-1
   encoding does not contain the € (EUR) sign (but the ¤ "general currency
   sign"), whereas the ISO-8859-15 encoding does; the byte `A4` is thus
   interpreted differently by these encodings)

A [special comment on the 1st or 2nd
line](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#encoding-declarations)

``` python
# -*- coding: <encoding-name> -*-
```

explicitly denotes the source code file encding.

The default Python source code encoding is
[UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).

### Line Continuation

Usually a statement ends with a newline. If long statements need to be
formatted to span multiple lines for readability the line continuation
character "\" can be used. This is called explicit line joining:

``` python
x = (operand1 + operand2) * \
    (operand1 - operand2)
```


As code enclosed in parentheses (...) (and brackets [...], braces {...} and
triple quotes) can span multiple line the line continuation character is often unnecessary:

``` python
"""A long docstring comment on this example.

Triple-quoted strings can span
multiple lines.
"""


if (condition_a
        and condition_b
        and condition_c):
    do_this()


german_month_names = [
    # comments are allowed
    'Januar', 'Februar', 'März',       # Q1
    'April', 'Mai', 'Juni',            # Q2
    'Juli', 'August', 'September',     # Q3
    'Oktober', 'November', 'Dezember'  # Q4
    ]

# dictionaries more often than not span lines
german_months = { 
    1: 'Januar',
    2: 'Februar',
    3: 'März',
    4: 'April',
    5: 'Mai',
    6: 'Juni',
    7: 'Juli',
    8: 'August',
    9: 'September',
    10: 'Oktober',
    11: 'November',
    12: 'Dezember'
    } 
```

This is called implicit line joining.

Tip: This and Python's *implicit string concatenation* can be used to format
lines:
``` python
>>> "12" "34"   "56"  # implicit string concatenation
'123456'
>>> hash("12"
...      "34"
...      "56")
239865887022063660
>>> hash("123456")
239865887022063660
```

This can be handy e.g. for formatting function calls with longer string
parameters (i.e. not so short as in this example...).

### Annotations

#### Function Annotations

Optional function annotations can be used e.g. as a means to more clearly
document the type(s) of arguments a function (or method) expects:

``` python
def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
    return 'Hello {}!'.format(name)
```

This information can be accessed at runtime:

``` python
>> def say_hello(name: str) -> str:  
...     return 'Hello {}!'.format(name)
... 
>>> say_hello.__annotations__
{'name': <class 'str'>, 'return': <class 'str'>}
>>> 
```

Note that the Python interpreter *does not* do any type checking using this
information:

``` python
>>> say_hello('Lisa')
'Hello Lisa!'
>>> say_hello(8.5)
'Hello 8.5!'
>>> 
```

A function annotation is actually an expression i.e. not necessarily limited
to a type. The expression is evaluated at function definition execution:

``` python
>>> def say_hello(name: 'what' + '?') -> 7+3:  
...     return 'Hello {}!'.format(name)
... 
>>> say_hello.__annotations__
{'name': 'what?', 'return': 10}
>>> 
```

Function annotations gain meaning by usage in libraries or tools; the Python
interpreter does not do anything with them apart from 

 - evaluating the expressions when the function definition is executed and thus
 - "associating" this information with the function properties (i.e. its
   parameters and return values)

Function annotations can be used for several purposes at compile or run time,
e.g.

 - in optional "compile time" type checkers
 - in editors or IDEs to provide rich code completion, type checking and
   formatting & highlighting capabilities and refactoring support 
 - to implement "generic functions" that dispatch on parameter type
 - to generate code (see e.g. the use of type annotations in the
   [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) standard
   library module)

and more.

#### Variable Annotations

In the same way function parameters and return types may be annotated you can
annotate (module, class or instance) variables:

An annotated variable:

``` python
>>> x: str = "text"
>>> x
'text'
```

Again, the annotations can be accessed through the `__annoations__` dict:

``` python
>>> __annotations__  # module-level (here: interactive session)
{'x': <class 'str'>}
>>> 
```

An annotated class:

``` python
>>> class Knight:
...     knows: str = 'ni'
...     
...     def __init__(self, words: list):
...         self.words: str = words
...     
...     def say_something(self):
...         print(self.knows)
...     
...     def say_something_personal(self):
...         print(' '.join(self.words))
... 
>>> knight = Knight(['my', 'words'])
>>> knight.say_something()
ni
>>> knight.say_something_personal()
my words
```

Thesee nnotations are then available at class or instance level:
``` python
>>> Knight.__annotations__  # class level
{'knows': <class 'str'>}
>>> 
>>> knight.__init__.__annotations__  # instance level
{'words': <class 'list'>}
>>> knight.__annotations__
{'knows': <class 'str'>}
>>> 
```

Like other annotations these are optional and not used by the interpeter
itself but libraries and tools.

See the [typing stdlib module
documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) for
infrastructure with regard to (type hint) annotation.

Annotations and typing have evolved pretty much in the past few Python 3 years
and are still in flux. Modern Pythons support e.g. more convenient language
sugar than their predecessors, like support for "generics" syntax for standard
collections:

Python >= 3.9:

``` python
>>> word_list: list[str]
>>> __annotations__
{'word_list': list[str]}

```

Python 3.8:

``` python
>>> word_list: list[str]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable
>>> from typing import List
>>> word_list: List[str]
>>> __annotations__
{'word_list': typing.List[str]}
>>>
```

In some cases older Python's might already provide this feature by means of
a `__future__` import.

``` python
>>> from __future__ import annotations
>>> word_list: list[str]
>>> vector_3d: tuple[float]
```

### Decorators

The `@`-syntax introduces decorators:
``` python
>>> @some_decorator
... def f():
...    pass
... 
```

See the [decorators chapter](decorators.md) for more information.

## Names and Objects

Python variables are names for objects. An object can have many names:

``` python
>>> x = 1
>>> y = x
>>> x
1
>>> y
1
>>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
>>> l2 = l1
>>> l1
[1, 2, 3]
>>> l2
[1, 2, 3]
```

But it is still the same object:

``` python
>>> x is y  # is checks for object identity
True
>>> l1 is l2
True
>>> id(x), id(y)  # id() returns an object's unique id
(140700697906560, 140700697906560)
>>> id(l1), id(l2)
(140700698907784, 140700698907784)
```

Compare that to the meaning of variables in other languages, e.g. C.

In C (or C++) a variable is basically the in-program name for a "memory cell"
(a memory location that can hold a value of the type declared for that variable
). Thus, assignment in C/C++ means writing a value of the proper type into that
"memory cell".

Whereas a variable in Python is rather one "label" (of potentially many) for an
object in a sense more analogous to a C++ reference or a C pointer: a name for
an object.

Consequently, assignment in Python means "pinning" a new name to an object; it 
*never* copies data.[^c-assignment]

[^c-assignment]: Whereas in C/C++ assignment usually copies data.

Deleting a name doesn't affect object existence:
``` python
>>> del x
>>> y
1
```
(as long as there is still a name (or another object) *referencing* that
object)

**Further reading**: A great in-depth explanation can be found
[here](https://nedbatchelder.com/text/names1.html).

## Python Scoping

A scope defines the visibility of names. The lookup of names in Python obeys
the "LEGB"-Rule:

 1. **L**ocal
 1. **E**nclosing
 1. **G**lobal
 1. **B**uiltin

The workings of LEGB by example:

``` python
>>> global_x = "I'm global"
>>> 
>>> def f():  # functions define scope
...     print(global_x)  # lookup in local scope (nothing), then in global
scope
...     
...     def inner():
...         local_z = "I'm local"  # a name in inner local scope
...         print(local_z)
...         print(enclosing_y)     # local (nothing), enclosing -> enclosing_y
...         print(global_x)        # local (nothing), enclosing (nothing), 
...                                # global -> global_x
...         print('print() is a built-in!')
...     
...     # variable in local scope of f == enclosing scope of inner    
...     enclosing_y = "I'm enclosing (for inner), local for f"
...     # run inner function
...     inner()
... 
>>> f()       
I'm global
I'm local
I'm enclosing (for inner), local for f
I'm global
print() is a built-in!
>>> 
```

### Python Classes "Unscoped"

Note that the class body block of a class definition *does not* form an
enclosing scope for the methods of the class:

``` python
>> class FunctionsDefineScope:
...      
...     # class attributes 
...     cls_var = 'common'
...     another_cls_var = 'also ' + cls_var  # name in the same scope is usable
...     
...     def show_me(self):
...         # class body is not an enclosing scope for method body...
...     
...         # access class attributes...
...         # ...through class
...         print(FunctionsDefineScope.cls_var,
...               FunctionsDefineScope.another_cls_var)
...         # ...through instance
...         print(self.cls_var, self.another_cls_var)
...         
...         # this will raise:
...         print(cls_var, another_cls_var)
... 
>>> fds = FunctionsDefineScope()
>>> fds.show_me()
common also common
common also common
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 17, in show_me
NameError: name 'cls_var' is not defined
>>> 
```


## Style guide

Python has a widely accepted
[style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Follow it.

## Be pythonic
Python programmers often strive to write code that is said to be "pythonic",
which means it has a certain quality of beauty (as in being working, functional, elegant yet maintainable and readable).

While "pythonic" can understandably not be a very well-defined term the
[Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) is a collection of
Python's language design guiding principles which can also be put to good use
in your quest to write "pythonic" code.
