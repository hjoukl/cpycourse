!!! question "Lesson: Reverse Words"
    Create a function that
    
      - takes a single string argument and
      - returns a string with the words of the original argument in reversed
        order

    E.g. when given `"Mary says hi"` the function returns `"hi says Mary"`.

    Optionally: Create a Python script `reverse_words.py` that takes a 
    string command line argument and prints the words of this argument
    in reversed order. E.g. when executed as
    
    `python3 reverse_words.py "Mary says hi"` the program prints
    `"hi says Mary"`.

    Hint 1: You can access the command line arguments through `sys.argv`.

    Hint 2: Python features an extensive command line parsing library in the
    stlib: `argparse`.

    Optionally: Add options to the function and the script that allow for
    returning/printing the result string
    
      - reversed or unreversed and that in
      - all-uppercase, all-lowercase, titlecase or capitalized.

    Hint 3: Use `help("")` or `help(str)` to learn useful string methods.
