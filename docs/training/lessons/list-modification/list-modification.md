!!! question "Lesson: List Modification"

    === "Task"
    
        Starting out with
        
        ```python
        >>> my_list = ['Agathe', 'Bauer']
        ```
        
        modify `my_list` by
        
         - changing the 1st element to "I've"
         - changing the 2nd lement to "got"
         - extending my_list with a 3rd element "the power"

         in-place, i.e. not by creating a new list object from my_list.

    === "Hints"
    
        You can use `help([])` to see extensive documentation on `list`
        operations.

    === "Solution"

        ??? example "*Really* take a peek now?"

            ``` python title="list_modification.py"
            --8<-- "training/lessons/list-modification/list_modification.py"
            ```
