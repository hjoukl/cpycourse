!!! question "Lesson: List Modification"

    === "Task"
    
        Starting out with
        
        ```python
        >>> l = ['Agathe', 'Bauer']
        ```
        
        modify `l` by
        
         - changing the 1st element to "I've"
         - changing the 2nd lement to "got"
         - extending l with a 3rd element "the power"

         in-place, i.e. not by creating a new list object from l.

    === "Hints"
    
        You can use `help([])` to see extensive documentation on `list`
        operations.
