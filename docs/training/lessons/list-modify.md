!!! question "Lesson: List Modification"
    Starting out with
    ```python
    >>> l = ['Agathe', 'Bauer']
    ```
    modify `l` by
    
     - changing the 1st element to "I've"
     - changing the 2nd lement to "got"
     - extending l with a 3rd element "the power"

     in-place, i.e. not by creating a new list object from l.

     Hint: You can use `help([])` to see extensive documentation on `list`
     operations.
